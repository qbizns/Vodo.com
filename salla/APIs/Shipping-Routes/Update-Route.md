        This endpoint allows you to update the details of an existing shipping
        route by passing its `id` as a path parameter.

        You can change the route name, type, status, and priority, and also
        update the list of companies, branded settings, conditions, and
        strategy.

        This helps control how the route works and appears during checkout.
