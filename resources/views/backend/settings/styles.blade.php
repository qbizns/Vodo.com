{{-- 
    Settings styles are now loaded from /backend/css/pages/settings.css via SPA CSS loader.
    
    For AJAX/SPA navigation: CSS is loaded dynamically by main.js when data-require-css="settings" is detected
    For full page loads: CSS is included via app.blade.php based on current page
    
    This file is kept for backwards compatibility but no longer pushes styles to the stack.
